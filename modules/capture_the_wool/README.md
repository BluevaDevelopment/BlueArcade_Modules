## Description
Capture enemy wools from their base and bring them back to yours. First team to capture all wools wins.

## Game type notes
This is a **Minigame**: it is designed for standalone arenas, but it can also be used inside party rotations. Minigames usually provide longer, feature-rich rounds.

## What you get with BlueArcade 3 + this module
- Party system (lobbies, queues, and shared party flow).
- Store-ready menu integration and vote menus.
- Victory effects and end-game celebrations.
- Scoreboards, timers, and game lifecycle management.
- Player stats tracking and placeholders.
- XP system, leaderboards, and achievements.
- Arena management tools and setup commands.

## Features
- Team size and team count configuration.
- Owner/capture team mapping per wool.
- Per-player chest duplication (items are never consumed from real chests).
- Block protection on wool locations and player-placed-only breaking.
- Team restricted zones to limit area access per team.
- Respawn on death with configurable delay.

## Arena setup
### Common steps
Use these steps to register the arena and attach the module:

- `/baa create <id> <standalone|party>` — Create a new arena in standalone or party mode.
- `/baa arena <id> setname <name>` — Give the arena a friendly display name.
- `/baa arena <id> setlobby` — Set the lobby spawn for the arena.
- `/baa arena <id> minplayers <amount>` — Define the minimum players required to start.
- `/baa arena <id> maxplayers <amount>` — Define the maximum players allowed.
- `/baa game <id> add mini capture_the_wool` — Attach this minigame module to the arena.
- `/baa stick` — Get the setup tool to select regions.
- `/baa game <id> capture_the_wool bounds set` — Save the game bounds for this arena.
- ~~`/baa game <id> capture_the_wool spawn add`~~ — Not used in Capture The Wool.
  Use **`/baa game <id> capture_the_wool team spawn <team_id>`** to configure team spawns.
- ~~`/baa game <id> capture_the_wool time <minutes>`~~ — Not used in Capture The Wool.
  Capture The Wool has no time limit. The match ends when a team captures all enemy wool objectives.

### Module-specific steps

- `/baa game <id> capture_the_wool team count <value>` — Set the number of teams (minimum 2).

- `/baa game <id> capture_the_wool wool create <wool_id> <MATERIAL> <owner_team>` — Create a wool objective with shared ID, material, owner team, and spawn point (select exactly one block with the setup tool).
- `/baa game <id> capture_the_wool wool capture <wool_id> <capture_team>` — Set capture point and stealing team for that wool (select exactly one block with the setup tool). The owner team is rejected as capture team.
- `/baa game <id> capture_the_wool wool clearcapture <wool_id>` — Clear the configured capture point and stealing team for a wool.
